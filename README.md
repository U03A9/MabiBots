# Description
AutoHotKey bot to automate the skill training grind in Mabinogi

## How to use
- Install AutoHotKey from [here]()
- Compile the script into a `exe` (helps prevent anti-cheat from seeing AHK running)
- Run compiled executable as an administrator (required for Mabinogi to detect input)

## Examples
- Examples coming soon

### This bot is made with various specific needs. It is not generic and you can not just run it as is. You will need to modify your hotkeys or write new functions. I will work on creating more generic functions for use in the future if I see the need. I am nearly done with all of my skills
